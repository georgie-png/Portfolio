From this misfitting we emerged an understanding of how FLOSS does not make room or time for accessibility, neither does it imagine it as essential.<br>From this friction the workshop also made Wiggle Room to improvise and hack together an automated live captioning setup that made room for everyone to meet through FLOSS online, but also for people to setup their own local live captioning software on their computer if they wanted it.

Alongside this is also shared here how the different FLOSS video call and automated caption software we tried and that lacked the capacities that was wanted for the workshop.<br><br>It does have to be said that even with this desire to manifest FLOSS access, the improvised automated captions we came up with still ended up working with big tech solutions. In discussion we felt working here with google's local automated caption on a FLOSS video call was a way to Wiggle Room towards access within FLOSS. Even though this approach also did ask individuals to configure their own access, we tried to offer up interdependent access through clear instructions, as well as being their to debug issues. This need for collective configuration was also felt to be a place to be in contact with and make sense of automated captioning software.<br><br> If you need to use Live Caption here are steps to run them locally on Chrome.

We both did not host a Jitsi instance, nor could find one that had this already installed.\n<br>After the first workshop, we also realized that Jitsi can only host a small group of people, and the

By trying to get cozy you start to make these transformations, so settle in and lets get cozy.<br><br><br><img alt=\"A cloud sits unsure on a day with mixed weather.

This is great for accessibility but also tends to scope and direct the abilities and capacities you have on your computer, as in there are only so many buttons or things you can show in a communicable way. <br><br><br><img alt=\"howdy.png\" src=\"https://configure-able.info/in-grid/collective-infrastructures/media/howdyterminal.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>Terminal is a more classic way of working with a machine, and roughly speaking is the step between punch-card/magnetic tape style computing and a GUI. It is a very simple but powerful interface that lets you run basically any command on your system through a text interface. Compared to a GUI this space is more \"risky\" as you can do anything from anywhere, such as deleting the entire hard disc (not advised). It also means that there are no limitations to your system administration so you have access to a granular level of working. <br><br><br>When entering into this more \"risky\" space on a computer network, it is good to set some intentions and work out how to move through this space with care. As we go though these next steps getting into terminal have a think about what it means to be in this place of power/risk, and what relations you think you need to care for and form protocols for?<br>It can also be a great place to think about if/how your system let's you into this place of power, and what relations this empowering brings with it. <br><br><br>This depends on your platform, so...<br><br><br>On a Mac it is already installed!

These docs were made during the infrastructuring process to help us share and explain how to setup the back-end VPN and server infrastructure with collaborators.

Through Acton's understanding and approach to plain language we began to question how technical language can start to move towards a plain language version.

To do this we will think through how we have found frictions, or inflexibility when working socially and technically.

This is great for accessibility but also tends to scope and direct the abilities and capacities you have on your computer, as in there are only so many buttons or things you can show in a communicable way. <br><br><br><img alt=\"A screenshot of a terminal interface with the Echo command used to write out &quot;Howdy&quot;\" src=\"https://configure-able.info/in-grid/collective-infrastructures/media/howdyterminal.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>Terminal is a more classic way of working with a machine, and roughly speaking is the step between punch-card/magnetic tape style computing and a GUI. It is a very simple but powerful interface that lets you run basically any command on your system through a text interface. Compared to a GUI this space is more \"risky\" as you can do anything from anywhere, such as deleting the entire operating system (not advised). It also means that there are no limitations to your system administration so you have access to a granular level of working. <br><br><br>Prompt\nWhen entering into this more \"risky\" space on a computer network, it is good to set some intentions and work out how to move through this space with care. As we go though these next steps getting into terminal have a think about what it means to be in this place of power/risk, and what relations you think you need to care for in the formation of these protocols?\nIt can also be a great place to think about if/how the relations of a system enables you to perform this role of power, and what change in relations this new role brings with it. <br><br><br>This depends on your platform, so...<br><br><br>On a Mac it is already installed! So all you need to do is:<br>\n<br>Search up Terminal\n<br>Open it!\n<br><br><br>There are similar programs to terminal already installed, but not the same language (bash). There are a few ways to do this, but I recomend installing an ubuntu vm shell for bash, as it gives the most capability for this use case:<br>\n<br>Install the VM from the windows store <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PDXGNCFSCZV?ocid=pdpshare\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PDXGNCFSCZV?ocid=pdpshare\" target=\"_self\">HERE</a>and remember your password!\n<br>Then open it up!\n<br><br><br>As we said before terminal is a text/syntax-based way of interfacing your machine and we are going to introduce a few basic commands and concepts to get us going today.<br><br><br>Let's simply use echo to get our terminal to say HI!.<br>To do this use:<br>echo &lt;message&gt;\n<br>e.g.<br>echo HI!\n<br><br><br>Now lets see who your computer!<br>Show the name of the currently logged in user:<br>whoami\n<br>Show the name of the machine is given on the network:<br>hostname\n<br><br><br>Much of working on the command line involves navigating around your system without the use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).<br>However, we will essentially be navigating around normal computer folder hierarchies like below:<br>root/\n├─ directoryname/ ├─ anotherdirectory/ ├─ aFileName.txt\n<br><br>Directory&nbsp;: also known as a folder<br>Print working directory that you are currently in:<br>pwd\n<br>List current directory contents:<br>ls\n<br><br><br>Now to move between directories/folders we use cd like so<br>cd &lt;directory_name&gt;\n<br>e.g.<br>cd folder1\n<br>\nWe can use a folder that was shown with ls in the last step!<br>\nYou can also check whats in the new folder with ls to see that you have moved.\n<br><br><br>Prompt\nIn this potentially unfamiliar space how do we keep track of where we are, what we've done &amp; what commands we may need in the future?\nBasically how do we want to orient ourselves?\n<br><br><br>Secure Shell (SSH) is a way of working on another machine from your own, working in their shell (bash). <br>It basically lets you work on another computers terminal remotely. This is the way you will work on most servers or remote/faceless computers (computers without a screen).<br><br><br><img alt=\"Diagram showing how these devices are connected and communicate over the internet and via the SSH protocol.\" src=\"https://configure-able.info/in-grid/serving_in-grid/media/sshdiagram.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><br><br>The SSH protocol enables us to talk securely to our server by encrypting and authenticating all of our communication/interfacing through the network. <br>Traditionally tech has a metaphor of SSH as a secure hand shake protocol, but it will be great to think about what metaphor or relation we want when it comes to crossing boundaries and into shared spaces. <br>Do we want to hand shake or do we think . . . would enable . . . <br><br><br>Again this may be a bit different on different systems, as some will have this already installed and some will need to install it. <br>Install it with:<br>sudo apt install openssh-client\n<br>If you are on gitbash on windows, it should be installed.<br><br><br>To SSH into the Server with servus we need to use their IP!<br>An IP address is basically the postcode/address we will find the pi at on the network.<br>The IP for our Servus server is:<br>\n193.170.194.204<br>But we also have it as a named server:<br>\nvps.in-grid.io<br><br><br>Now that we have the IP address, any computer can request to SSH into the server through these commands:<br>ssh &lt;user_name&gt;@&lt;ip&gt;\n<br>eg.<br>ssh in-grid@193.170.194.204\n<br>or<br>ssh in-grid@vps.in-grid.io\n<br>You are now \"logging into\" our server, so it will ask for the password here and that I will share with you.<br><br><br>You should now see your terminal username change from your laptop's local user to something like: <br>in-grid@vps:~$ <br>If you want to exit out of the pi (we don't atm) type:<br>exit\n<br>Hit enter.

In this session we set up our Virtual Private Server (VPS) that is hosted with Servus. This aims to be an experimental server for us to test and make sense of our network infrastructuring practices. In the workshop we made room to figure out how we wanted to imagine and enact our infrastructure as we configured it. In this process both aiming to make the VPS and its technical practices accessible to members of In-grid, but in doing so making room to (dis)orient and care for the misfitting of these technical practices by bringing them in touch with our collective background and embodied expertise.<br>From this workshop, In-grid manifested our experimental VPS to be encoded through our own counter figures. These ranged from refusing the role of Users to instead be carers, maintainers, players, personas and collaborators. It also made room for us to come into contact with and make sense of the many layers of network security these technologies are kept \"safe\" through. In response to this sense-making of misfitting forming our own dialogues around how we imagine networks becoming safe through trust, care and intimacy. From manifesting our configure-able VPS infrastructure, we also turned to form our own manifesto for it, called the Femfester (In-grid et al., 2024), and which was published with Servus in the first edition of their <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://publications.servus.at/2024-Artists-Running-Data-Centers/ArtistsRunningDataCenters-servus-at_2024.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://publications.servus.at/2024-Artists-Running-Data-Centers/ArtistsRunningDataCenters-servus-at_2024.pdf\" target=\"_self\">Artists Running Datacentres</a> journal.<br><br><br><br>This entry shares the guide for the technical processes undertaken in the workshop.

Building on feminist Science and Technology Studies (STS) (Suchman 2012; Amoore 2020), the thesis interrogates the deterministic configurations, prescribed roles and relations that hold organizational and network infrastructures in place, while taking up crip and queer methods to further examine how such infrastructures create hard systems that reinforce ableist conceptions of use, access, and knowledge. Through the disobedient methods, practices and politics offered by Disability Justice, crip and queer theory (Ahmed 2006; Kafer 2013; 2023; Hamraie 2017; 2023; Rice et al. 2024), I question the inherited figures of configuration (such as “users”) and develop alternative ways of manifesting systems that are people-powered and center the needs of collectives instead of configuring people into infrastructural elements. Combining critique with practice, the thesis generates collective methods for making wiggle room (Ahmed 2014; Pritchard 2022) in network infrastructures for soft, situated, indeterminate, and misfitting embodied knowledges and emergent forms of collective life.<br>My research undertakes three inquiries into what configure-able infrastructures can be in action. Rather than abstract systems, these collective infrastructuring practices are situated, shaped, and manifested by specific contexts and bodies. In the first inquiry, I reflect on my practices and experiences of access making, examining how the misfitting of collective access and access riders can shape configurations from sites of friction. The second inquiry is grounded in collaboration with In-grid collective, a Trans*Feminist digital arts collective, exploring how critical access can inform collective intersectional practice from the outset, instead of being added on afterward. The final inquiry manifests crip network infrastructures by and for disabled people through work on the Cozy-Cloud, a crip server and collaborative practice. By making room for disabled people to form their own expertise, practices and knowledge of network infrastructures, it becomes possible to disorient the sedimented configurations of hard technical systems, and to form counter configure-able infrastructures that unfold from embodied knowledges, experiences and collective practices.<br>From these inquiries, the thesis offers methods and practices for disorienting the normative configurations of infrastructures through crip and queer forms of “misfitting” when accessing and using these systems, and the collective sense-making that unfolds.

Misfitting as a method makes space for bodies to (dis)orient infrastructures, relations and politics through their ambivalent relationships and embodied expertise to these systems. As a situated process, misfitting animates systems from their localities and shapes complex systems and knowing from emergent actions instead of set plans.<br>(Garland-Thomson 2011)<br>(Rice et al. 2024)<br><br><br>Friction is a process of access making. Friction arises both from the feeling of misfitting, and the ways that crip and queer bodies make sense of what barriers exist, as well as making access through friction, making disorienting requests, improvising infrastructures and transforming these feelings into change. In crip theory, friction rubs up against itself through wordplay; there can be pain from frictions, but there is also a possibility for pleasure and joy, which is often never imagined. Friction in this research is a place of joyous, pleasurable and embodied access making in action that also makes room for and validates its awkward and painful processes.<br>(Kafer 2013)<br>(Hamraie and Fritsch 2019)<br>(Hamraie 2023)<br><br><br>Wiggle room emerges from friction making around the categories and relations that people are prescribed by the norms of systems. People and communities make wiggle room together by feeling out how these determined categories and relations misfit the bodyminds they enclose and creating space through friction for relations that affirm their lives and desired orientations.<br>(Ahmed 2014)<br>(Pritchard 2022)<br><br><br>The Table is a metaphor for the institutional norms that have been gradually sedimented into determined and inflexible relations. Tables in this research take many forms, from my desk, to excell tables, to kitchen tables, to interview tables, and to operating tables. This research asks how these tables and their sedimented norms put limits on how we can be together in relation. In theory and practice, this thesis considers how we can start to wiggle room to disorient these tables to affirm our lives, community relations, practices and politics.<br>(Ahmed 2006)<br>(Suchman 2012)<br><br><br>The Crip Table imagines what a table shaped by crip politics and community might feel like. The crip table makes room to imagine how systems, infrastructures and their inflexible relations can be flexible to and shaped by the bodyminds they misfit and cause friction with towards indeterminate relations of life affirmation, community desire, and justice.<br>(Mingus 2017)<br>(Kafai 2021)<br>(Kafer 2023)<br>(Simms and Marangoni 2025)<br><br><br>The Bodily Horizon situates how bodies are in relation with the things around them. The Bodily Horizon makes room to question what is within reach, what can be changed, and what limits and capacities there are within the actions we take. It makes sense of the frictions of the present while also questioning how bodies desire to be oriented towards futures, and what they desire to be within reach. The Bodily Horizon comes from a body in motion, one that feels and makes change between the present and the future.<br>(Ahmed 2006)<br><br><br>In crip theory, the Bodymind is the refusal of the split between mind and body made within Western medicine and philosophy. The bodymind is a place of feeling, sense- and knowledge-making. In breaking down boundaries between mind and body, this research is also intimate with the boundaries between bodies and the relations that impact or misfit them.
