is a data preparation pipeline I made for the F-MNIST dataset. The work came about from collaborating with <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://meganbenson.me/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://meganbenson.me/\" target=\"_self\">Meg Benson</a> and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://yasminmorgan.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://yasminmorgan.com/\" target=\"_self\">Yasmin Morgan</a>. In conversations we wanted to question how we could make a chaotic dataset of hand written letters to form our own dataset and generate a local dataset of fonts with our intentions and contexts entangled into them. This data set explored how we could disorient the standardised norms of AI datasets such as the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database\" target=\"_self\">MNIST</a> (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) by trying to de-isolate and un-normalize their indexes and figures by situating them, bringing in their backgrounds and entangling them together. We also left space within the inputs for people to add their own symbols and data outside of the limits of the Latin alphabet. <br><img src=\"background/f-mnist_dataset/media/fmnist_dataset.gif\" target=\"_self\">This work did this technically by scanning in hand written samples on paper and splitting them into the different segments. In the interface for doing this it also made room for people to add intentions for their data as well as their name and bits about their background. I wrote this in python and used a rdflib to write a custom linked open data (LOD) dataset that entangled the images to this data through semantic triples. This was informed by a workshopI attended called Fermenting Data1 by Magdalena Tyżlik-Carver, Lozana Rossenova and Lukas Fuchsgruber, where they made room within the semantic triples of LOD to form and unfold different relations in data.This project didn't make it past being a pipeline mainly due to two frictions. The first that at this point I had not focused on a technical practice that was very shareable or accessible to my collaborators, and so it lost momentum. The second was that this would have been best served online, as this would make room for the dataset to unfold as it was added to, but none of us had those technical skills and so it stayed scanned/paper base. In this reflection though the work did make room for me to question in collaboration the ways we could imagine and store data in more nuanced and situated ways to try and trouble the ways AI and ML are approached.<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/CorsicAr/DataProccessing\" target=\"_self\">https://github.com/CorsicAr/DataProccessing</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"background/f-mnist_dataset/media/fmnist_dataset.gif","fullURL":"background/f-mnist_dataset/f-mnist_dataset.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["background/f-mnist_dataset/media/fmnist_dataset.html"],"createdTime":1756238143811,"modifiedTime":1760556754098,"sourceSize":2349,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/Practice/Background/F-MNIST_Dataset/F-MNIST_Dataset.md","exportPath":"background/f-mnist_dataset/f-mnist_dataset.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":4,"backlinks":["background/background-to-retreat.html"],"type":"markdown"},"background/neural_re-presentation/media/neural-representation.html":{"title":"neural representation","icon":"","description":"<img src=\"background/neural_re-presentation/media/neural-representation.gif\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"Thesis/dist/01_background/neural_re-presentation/media/neural-representation.gif","fullURL":"background/neural_re-presentation/media/neural-representation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":["background/neural_re-presentation/media/neural-representation.html"],"createdTime":1756238143840,"modifiedTime":1756238143866,"sourceSize":12294664,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/Practice/Background/Neural_Re-Presentation/media/neural representation.gif","exportPath":"background/neural_re-presentation/media/neural-representation.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":7,"backlinks":["background/neural_re-presentation/neural-re-presentation.html"],"type":"attachment"},"background/neural_re-presentation/neural-re-presentation.html":{"title":"Neural Re-Presentation","icon":"","description":"<img src=\"background/neural_re-presentation/media/neural-representation.gif\" target=\"_self\">This work explored working with Reinforcement Learning agents, specifically multi-agent environments. In these environments inquiring through practice the relations these agents were able to make together and what where their capacities to learn and represent their environment. In this setup, which is one of a few I made, I oriented them to be able to communicate through a visual layer together whilst trying to navigate a simple task of not touching, but staying close to one another. The visual layer that they produced was their only mode of feedback to the environment and oriented them to form a visual language to communicate through, and one in which the viewer can intercept their communications.<br>This work was presented at 4S 2023, as part of their making and doing exhibition and received nice feedback from the community there. I did end up stopping to work with these agents for a few reasons, mainly because of some of the critiques I make in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"01.01.00_Background.md\" href=\"thesis/repo/thesis/01_introduction/01_entries/01.01.00_background.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.01.00_Background</a> of the introduction. These orient that RL algorithms centrally rely upon penal logics and outdated theories of animal and child learning to train these agents, and when I tried to find other ways of relating to them I couldn't.

The reason I highlight this project in the background is because it is one where I implemented a different type of intelligent or learning algorithm through the logics of artificial immune systems, instead of artificial intelligence. This modelling of these logics produced interesting dynamics within this artistic simulation, and produced different emergent relations. Interestingly for this research it artificial immune systems oriented a selection system, like immune systems, that centres diversity of output to approach the unknown, instead of refining a thin line of categorisation like artificial intelligence often does. To do this I developed a GPU computed multi-agent system that made room for 3000+ agents (viruses, t-cells and sentinels) to learn and emerge different relations together.This was one of the more interesting configurations of intelligence as it both oriented outside a restrictive centralised narratives of cognitive intelligence, and towards intelligence and knowing as abundant and diverse.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"Thesis/dist/01_background/sentinel_self/media/pasted-image-20250821111813.png","fullURL":"background/sentinel_self/sentinel-self.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["background/sentinel_self/media/pasted-image-20250821111813.html"],"createdTime":1756238143866,"modifiedTime":1760556754108,"sourceSize":1423,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/Practice/Background/Sentinel_Self/Sentinel Self.md","exportPath":"background/sentinel_self/sentinel-self.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":12,"backlinks":["background/background-to-retreat.html"],"type":"markdown"},"background/background-to-retreat.html":{"title":"Background to Retreat","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"A minimal icon illustrates a picture frame hanging from a thread.

This means I do the following: Use an active voice\nMostly use the 6000 most common words in the English language\nUse short sentences\nUse 14 point font\nUse “I” and “you” Following Acton, In-grid understands this as not trying to assimilate dialogues into dominant technical talking points, but we approach this practice through critical access to distribute and share the expertise of systems and make the disputable from many backgrounds and knowledges.In-grid also approaches this as a place of design friction. This is where we have made room within and around these hard network infrastructures with and for our softer practices of collective access.

The focus will be accessible to member's reorientation but it will be a time for us to look back and reflect on how we have started to configure our own infrastructure and background away from big tech institutions and towards feminist and intersectional community infrastructures. In this reflection I hope for us to articulate together through processing our inquiry, a few figures (metaphors) of our own to make accessible these situated relations. To do this we will think through how we have found frictions, or inflex when working socially and technically. These will form contours for us to reflect on how we have enabled our collaboration to be in-flex-able together. This interplay being the place we form figures and narratives of access from, and where we as a collaboration have flexed towards accessible futures and away from institutional inflex.\nGo over questions for G\nDefine together inflex and in-flex + qs to help us think through them.\nFeel out some topics or experiences to reflect on the inflex and then our in-flex-ability.\nWhat are the systematic and institutional relations that hold/held us in place? From Ahmed - lines holding norms of relations in place. + Aimi Hamraie Flexibile users and soft bodies being conformed to hard machines. Systemic issues around CAPITALISM aside. University structure, jobs/working relationships hold some elements in place, and enable certain actions. Institutions, these come with some privileges but academia/large institutions can be ableist, smaller grass roots organisations that are not driven by the logics of capitalism can enable alt spaces. How we stay attached to these institutions or stay with the difficulties of systemic issues, but find wiggle room, how we make wiggle room. All the other things, like race, class, gender etc etc etc Social and also contractual relationships Time = money under the jobbing job world. And collectivising means we can pool time or labour in a time-poor world. The Catch 22 of being able to prioritise art/research/things that matter for early career researchers/artists/makers is that you already have to have done these things to get the jobs/roles where you are given time for that. Post-austerity efficiency\nWhat are the things that disable(d) us from doing what we desire(d) in that relation? Time, space, funding, prestige, brain space, emotional capacity Dumb systems that's difficult to work with (Ex: No bank options for non- profitable small collective) Working as a collective, that is not a business or a charity or an institution, makes it difficult to interface with other bodies. Transitioning from a group of individuals to a group that is legally definable? Right to work, visas etc wage labour slavery &amp; and chronic health un-diagnosis that both disable/enable my capacity to do anything whether for work or socially, or towrds organising/meeting/ etc What restrains/ed our capacities relationally and materially?\naccountability to each other as a group\ndefining the boundaries of the group. intimacy / maintaining intimacy (is protecting too intense a word), while balancing openness. Project Grant Funding topics (not for this focus group). Maybe we need to be more strict about who we are inviting in and for how long, what the accountabilities etc\nexpectations from others in terms of availability/ capacity\nWhat does this friction contour?\nWanting to be open but additionally needing some static for contracts and stuff\nToo much admin workload on a few people when having more flexible form/ infrastructure\nHow do/did we process and feel out that restraint?\nAccept what works for the moment and being honest about the solution and the restraint\nHow did we (want to) flex and wiggle towards our desires?What did we do to enable us to get close to the space/relation possible that we needed?How would we have changed or approached this differently?

Do add or edit if you feel they misrepresent or you have q's or other opinions. . . talks about my approach with Ahmed and Kafer to think about crip intersectional manifestings as a way to orient other paths towards life affirmation and disability justice. It takes the crip approach of imperfect manfistings that take practice and care, in their imperfection form bodies on horizons to orient from/to together.Talking about my methodology of disobedient action-research. This focuses on action research that moves beyond the scales of institutions and derives from direct actions into forming relations, infrastructures and imaginaries together. It also routes itself within first person action research, forming dialogues that entangle internal feelings and politics, with external actions and relations.This is a mapping of an internal arc of the research, and starts to re-orient critical access and configuration methods by brining them into contact with each other. In bringing them into contact I aim to see what impression they make on each other and how we can rethink access as a relational configuration practice and configuration practices as material/political processes.(Hamraie, 2017) - <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.5749/j.ctt1pwt79d.6\" target=\"_self\">https://doi.org/10.5749/j.ctt1pwt79d.6</a>.Writes about the formation of the figure of the user within industrial design and how this was formed from the understanding that human bodies are soft and malleable unlike machines, which are hard, determined and static things humans have to be shaped around. This pulls from a eugenics histories, and also orient ergonomics as a place to shape people as much as it is machines to humans. With critical access here Hamraie questions how we can make room for machines to flex to users instead of this normalising and violent history. <br>(Cowan &amp; Rault, 2024) - <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://punctumbooks.com/titles/heavy-processing/\" target=\"_self\">https://punctumbooks.com/titles/heavy-processing/</a>Talks about bringing queer practices of heavy processing social relations as a way to re-approach the heavy processing needed to start to imagine ethical, de-colonial and anti-abelist technologies.

As we rub up against and dance our way into network practices, a festering acts as a place to form intentions and imagine how we want to collectively meet here. We fester as we care for the holes in our pipelines, tend to the ooze that undulates out and sit with these leaky seamful infrastructures. We don't aim to cure these frictions or plug these holes, but to care for them. We ask how we can enable infrastructuring to fester otherwise from our pulsating practices? A femfestering Server . . . . . - Is a situated technology. The server feels out their context and considers themselves to be part of an ecology of practices. - Is maintained by a community that cares enough for the frictions of accessing and maintaining a server, and where these frictions feel like a generative affair. - Ferments the materiality of software, hardware and the relations of the bodies gathered around them. - Opens themselves to expose the difficult processes, tools, sources, habits and patterns to make accessible these difficulties. - Does not strive for seamlessness, as it creates a bubble. Talk of transparency too often signals that something is being made invisible and inaccessible. - Avoids efficiency, ease-of-use, scalability and immediacy because they can be cages we need to abolish. - Knows that networking is actually an awkward, promiscuous, interdependent and pleasurable practice. - Is autonomous in that they feel out their own dependencies, relations and politics. - Radically questions the conditions for serving and service; practices queering client-server relations where they can. - Approaches network technology and sociotechnical systems as places of social change. - Enables networks and their practices to be improvise-able and read-write accessible. - Does not confuse safety with security. - Takes the risk of exposing their insecurity. - Tries hard not to apologies when they are not available, as they learn to communicate their capacities. In-grid is a trans*feminist collective of artists/musicians/educators/hackers working with*for accessible digital infrastructures. In-grid has been working together since 2019, and is made up of a fluid group of people who bring together exhibitions, infrastructures, parties, workshops and research projects.In the workshop to write the Femfester, In-grid members came together in person and online, ate some nice food and tasty snacks, caught up, but also set up their new server with Servus, and along the way (con)figured out what relations and politics we wanted to bring there and how!These are the prompts we made alongside setting up our VPS server with our members. Each step we reflect, re-imagine, and re(con)figure out what we desire each relation, space and dynamic to be for us together. These were done to enable us to find our collective orientation whilst orienting our infrastructures. These are all notes of much deeper and complex conversations, but try to map and inform where we are at.Here was a pre-figuring out of what we desired our coding relations to be. Doing things in pairs / groups Making sure everyone is on the same page before starting work Documentation *so choices can be rolled back/remade if necessary Be soft with sudo Working slowly, doing things in steps, not rushing through, stopping at a step rather than getting half way through something. double check what you are about to do before doing it, as may be irreversible * Talk Consider institutional implications for managed machines Keep everyone up to date. <br>Here we logged into the server through <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\" target=\"_self\">SSH</a> and questioned the metaphor and figure it brings of a handshake. When creating metaphors mention what is being replaced\nHere we approached the \"sudo\" command (means super user do), which enables admin rights on a system and for you to undertake maintenance. Here we imagined how we desired to configure these processes and rights.When sudo we should take extra care to make sure what we are doing is wanted by all. Work in pairs (if you can)? For any major changes at least... Should we be anonyms sudo? Or su user to trackShould sudo be used alone? Here we set up the users for the server, but also took time to manifest the figures we imagined being on this server. Here questioning the norms of user/server and individualized relations and how we want to enact them together otherwise.Not users but:maintainers?carers?Member?Players?Collaborators and caretakersit is nice to be individuals in a collectivecharactersConversationalistspersonaInfra as another collaborator not users/usingFistulas Here we uploaded SSH keys for those accounts and then closed password access to the server. This in norms makes the server \"sercure\", we took up this to imagine what safety means for us instead of security.Is transparency safety? No single point of failure/hidden information or is it helpful not to be able to delete something.Understanding the risks and making decisions based on understandingNot having knowledge lie with one personEveryone should have ability to access knowledgeDon't make ring-fence around particular rolesHow do we make people feel unafraid of making changesBut at the same time aware of what the \"risks\" areIs it more about learning how to move with caution and careThe idea is not to move fast / gung-ho / \"trigger happy\", but rather checking and double checking before doingHow can we do things like check a process before doing something, I'm thinking of Nginx command to check if the config file is valid before restarting the server... can we try to research that for all software we use? If we end up making our own tools, can we build caution / testing / care into our procedures, so that people feel confident that the changes they are about to make are safe to do? Demystifying what is safe protocols etc. Boundaries are helpful between the server and outside the serverHere we logged into TMUX an SSH multiplexer (basically a way to collaborate on server work). We wanted to imagine what collaborative relations we desired, but got caught up on TMUX technicalities. . . Turns out that typing exit in a string seems to exit it also Nominate who will type, and check in when people are getting tired. Take turns, maybe signal end of a string/phrase? Over, fin, out! fnx your turn bbzHere we turned our attention from (con)figuring out the server to manifesting how we wanted to serve In-grid. Here we started by returning to the original Feminist Server Manifesto, and reading it line by line together, each member taking it in turns, but also doing this no deterministically and one taking after where the other left off. We also chatted about our relations to it and how it had influenced us in our work and lives. Here we then took space to do a sedimented In-grid practice of free writing to enable all members to anonymously (+ without anxiety) and collectively form our own lines for a manifesto.New things: Balance between caution/testing/care and empowerment\nDoes not police language, but reads intentions and actionsForm different relations of access around both technology, critical thought and crip access.Enable us to practice and perform new relations of radical politics that we need now!Is not another cage to hold things in, or protect us from.

Talk of transparency too often signals that something is being made invisible (what is the relationship between seamlessness and transparency) Seamlessness require a lot of labour and obscure the effort behind the scenes.By making knowledge of a system or the system itself accessible, we don't need to make the system seamless? What is the difference between accessibility and transparency? Accessibility of sudoWe then took the original server manifesto's lines and started to align our own with them, figuring out how we oriented in different ways.A Festering Server is . . . . . a 10 minute manifesto\nIs a situated technology.

In this exchange we will materially and technically setup a server space, and along that journey together we will ask questions and discuss&nbsp;how we want to practice these technologies collectively.The end goal is to have collectively edited set of protocols or a manifesto that we publish to an html page on the server.Material for this workshop was developed from collaborative work over a number of iterations from projects including servpub, collective infrastructures and cozy-cloud.Outcomes from this workshop will also be used in my PhD as well as published in the new Servus journal? (I think it is) And I will make sure we are all credited!This workshop and the server are hosted by Servus in Linx Austria. They are an artist run data centre and have given us this space to practice our own network tech and projects. It is run on hydro electric energy and hosts a number of other collectives, tech enthusiasts and artists.We will be making and editing a manifesto of sorts as we work through the steps of this workshop. These will be hosted on an html file on the server, and is accessible at this URL page: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://femfester.in-grid.io/\" target=\"_self\">https://femfester.in-grid.io/</a><br>Until then we will edit them on this pad: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://digitalcare.noho.st/pad/p/Femfester\" target=\"_self\">https://digitalcare.noho.st/pad/p/Femfester</a>\np.s. Femfester can be changed.\nWhen it comes to making collaborative community driven sociotechnical infrastructure, there is always a complex network of relations that we have to work through. Negotiating every relation when we enter a space could be very complex and time consuming, as we will see, but setting protocols helps us firm up ways of working and relational conventions that ease this flow. Through setting these protocols together we mean to disobey the norms of network infrastructures and actively re-scope how we come to these systems and relations together.<br><img src=\"in-grid/serving-in-grid/media/servpubdiagram2024.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>Relating to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://areyoubeingserved.constantvzw.org/Summit_afterlife.xhtml\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://areyoubeingserved.constantvzw.org/Summit_afterlife.xhtml\" target=\"_self\">original feminist server manifesto</a> by some of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://constantvzw.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://constantvzw.org/\" target=\"_self\">Constant</a>.

This is great for accessibility but also tends to scope and direct the abilities and capacities you have on your computer, as in there are only so many buttons or things you can show in a communicable way. “Thesis 📖/workshops/serv(er)ing in-grid/media/howdyTerminal.png” could not be found.Terminal is a more classic way of working with a machine, and roughly speaking is the step between punch-card/magnetic tape style computing and a GUI. It is a very simple but powerful interface that lets you run basically any command on your system through a text interface. Compared to a GUI this space is more \"risky\" as you can do anything from anywhere, such as deleting the entire operating system (not advised). It also means that there are no limitations to your system administration so you have access to a granular level of working. Prompt\nWhen entering into this more \"risky\" space on a computer network, it is good to set some intentions and work out how to move through this space with care. As we go though these next steps getting into terminal have a think about what it means to be in this place of power/risk, and what relations you think you need to care for in the formation of these protocols?\nIt can also be a great place to think about if/how the relations of a system enables you to perform this role of power, and what change in relations this new role brings with it. This depends on your platform, so...On a Mac it is already installed! So all you need to do is:\nSearch up Terminal\nOpen it!\nThere are similar programs to terminal already installed, but not the same language (bash). There are a few ways to do this, but I recomend installing an ubuntu vm shell for bash, as it gives the most capability for this use case:\n<br>Install the VM from the windows store <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PDXGNCFSCZV?ocid=pdpshare\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PDXGNCFSCZV?ocid=pdpshare\" target=\"_self\">HERE</a>and remember your password!\nThen open it up!\nAs we said before terminal is a text/syntax-based way of interfacing your machine and we are going to introduce a few basic commands and concepts to get us going today.Let's simply use echo to get our terminal to say HI!.To do this use:echo &lt;message&gt;\ne.g.echo HI!\nNow lets see who your computer!Show the name of the currently logged in user:whoami\nShow the name of the machine is given on the network:hostname\nMuch of working on the command line involves navigating around your system without the use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).However, we will essentially be navigating around normal computer folder hierarchies like below:root/\n├─ directoryname/ ├─ anotherdirectory/ ├─ aFileName.txt\nDirectory&nbsp;: also known as a folderPrint working directory that you are currently in:pwd\nList current directory contents:ls\nNow to move between directories/folders we use cd like socd &lt;directory_name&gt;\ne.g.cd folder1 We can use a folder that was shown with ls in the last step!\nYou can also check whats in the new folder with ls to see that you have moved.\nPrompt\nIn this potentially unfamiliar space how do we keep track of where we are, what we've done &amp; what commands we may need in the future?\nBasically how do we want to orient ourselves?\nSecure Shell (SSH) is a way of working on another machine from your own, working in their shell (bash). It basically lets you work on another computers terminal remotely. This is the way you will work on most servers or remote/faceless computers (computers without a screen).<br><img src=\"in-grid/serving-in-grid/media/sshdiagram.jpg\" target=\"_self\">The SSH protocol enables us to talk securely to our server by encrypting and authenticating all of our communication/interfacing through the network. Traditionally tech has a metaphor of SSH as a secure hand shake protocol, but it will be great to think about what metaphor or relation we want when it comes to crossing boundaries and into shared spaces. Do we want to hand shake or do we think . . . would enable . . . Again this may be a bit different on different systems, as some will have this already installed and some will need to install it. Install it with:sudo apt install openssh-client\nIf you are on gitbash on windows, it should be installed.To SSH into the Server with servus we need to use their IP!An IP address is basically the postcode/address we will find the pi at on the network.The IP for our Servus server is:\n193.170.194.204But we also have it as a named server:\nvps.in-grid.ioNow that we have the IP address, any computer can request to SSH into the server through these commands:ssh &lt;user_name&gt;@&lt;ip&gt;\neg.ssh in-grid@193.170.194.204\norssh in-grid@vps.in-grid.io\nYou are now \"logging into\" our server, so it will ask for the password here and that I will share with you.You should now see your terminal username change from your laptop's local user to something like: in-grid@vps:~$ If you want to exit out of the pi (we don't atm) type:exit\nHit enter. You will need to have exited the pi before setting up your ssh key. Prompt\nHow do we navigate another machine through our own \"interface\"?\nWhat are the relational agreements to being on this other machine?\nSudo enables us to take on a superuser role.\nThis means that we have all the security permissions for that system. This is a \"very risky\" role, as here you can do anything on the server/computer. With sudo you can actually delete the entire system or make other similar drastic commands, but it also means that we have the ability to manage and configure our system to our needs.When we come to writing protocols for sudo, what does it mean for us to be a \"superuser\" or an admin, and what care and consideration should we take on in these protocols?<br><img src=\"in-grid/serving-in-grid/media/usersdiagram.jpg\" target=\"_self\">To become sudo or root you just need to:sudo su\nAnd then enter the password when prompted.Prompt\nSuper User can Do! a lot... what permissions are we comfortable navigating?\nHow intimate are we with our machines?\nCaring for a server includes routine tasks like updating/upgrading the system software, tiding up files, creating new users &amp; giving access permissions, paying attention to errors and bug reports.We are going to initiate this server by making us all users!<br><img src=\"in-grid/serving-in-grid/media/usersdiagram.jpg\" target=\"_self\">To make a new user, use the command below. Note, that you will be prompted to input a password and it is always better to give different users passwordsadduser &lt;nameofuser&gt;\nIf you want to give this user sudo access, then they have to be added to the \"sudo\" group. You don't need to create this group, it exists by default and you can just add or remove users from it. The sudo group is stored in this directory: /etc/sudoers.d/usermod -aG sudo &lt;nameofuser&gt;\nYou can check to see who is in the group sudo using this command: grep '^sudo:.*$' /etc/group\nNow you can change into the new user (in other words, sign into their account):su &lt;nameofuser&gt;\nYou could also log in now with:ssh &lt;username&gt;@193.170.194.204\norssh &lt;username&gt;@vps.in-grid.io\nAnd log in with the password you just added.Prompt\nHow can we re-imagine users to something less explicit and more gentle?\nHow do we want to configure the imaginaries to these roles?\nSSH Keys are user specific and are used in addition to a shared login password. To make this method of access truly secure we will need to eventually disable password-only login. The shared password is the Lock, and the private password is the Key. Keys are non-transferable and have to be generated per user. Make sure you are back on your own system with:exit\nThen to generate the keys, call this command: ssh-keygen -t rsa\nFill in the information requested (note: most of it is optional so you can leave it blank) and set a password (not optional).The shared key is the:id_rsa.puband the private Key is the:id_rsa Make note of the path to your id_rsa.pub, we'll need it in the next step.The public, Lock, password now needs to be copied over to the raspberry pi. Do this via this command (replacing the first bracket with the path to the id_rsa.pub, and the second to the Pis IP address, which we found earlier):ssh-copy-id -i &lt;path to id_rsa.pub&gt; &lt;username&gt;@vps.in-grid.io\nEnter password to complete transfer.I find it easiest to login with the key linked directly.sudo ssh -i &lt;path/to/id_rsa.pub&gt; &lt;username&gt;@vps.in-grid.io\nNote\nMaybe check you can become sudo with sudo su\nOnly do this after everyone who need to access the server has uploaded their Keys!It is also recommended that you keep one person ssh'd in at all times during testing this, so if you do something wrong you can unlock it again.Access the config file by:sudo nano -l /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nAnd in uncomment 'PasswordAuthentication' on line 57 and set to 'no', then save and exit:PasswordAuthentication no\nThen restart the SSH connection:sudo service ssh restart\nKeep someone logged in at all times!Have someone else log out and back in, trying with a password which should fail, and then the key which should work!Prompt\nNow this server is \"safe\" and secure, can we reflect on what that means to us?\nHow do we imagine this server being a safe space beyond SSH keys?\nTmux is what is called a multiplexer, which is a software that lets us collectively work one terminal session. This is how many collectives and collaborative networks work together on servers in one space. It lets us edit and run commands in one space and take responsibility and practice our infra becoming together.When we come to writing protocols we might want to think about what it means to be one user together, and how can we keep everyone at the same pace and comfortable levels of understanding. All become sudo with:sudo su\nNow we are all sudo we can initiate a shared session to work in together.To do this we use:tmux new -s &lt;session name&gt;\ne.g. tmux new -s in-sesh\nNow we need to name our collective space. If we think back*forward in this workshop, what are the intentions, dynamics and relations we want to collectively name this space with?Now we have an active session we can join it by just typing:tmux a -t in-sesh Rember we have to be sudo to join this!\nNow we can say hi to one another and say cute messages in the space by:echo &lt;message&gt;\nSay something to welcome each other into this session, you may need to take turns.As we saw even each of us writing an echo command takes a little bit of choreographing. When this gets more complicated, like writing complex configuration files, you can imagine it gets even more tricky.Prompt\nSo here we need to think about how we might manage collective editing. What operational metaphor might we use to describe the relationship between the person typing and the others? Who and how do we choose to type? How do we take care of every voice in that conversation?\nWe've created a simple html document to edit. We need to navigate to that file, open and edit it. First lets navigate to the folder its inside and list its contents.cd /var/www/femfester\nls\nWe should see a file called:index.html`Now we are in the right folder we can edit the file with nano which is a terminal base text editor. To open the file with nano we do:nano index.html\nThis will open the file in the terminal.“Thesis 📖/workshops/serv(er)ing in-grid/media/nanoOfHTML.png” could not be found.Tip\nBeing terminal you have to navigate with the keyboard, and also copy and past by right clicking (not \"CNTRL+C/P\")\nFrom here we can then add text and images using basic HTML syntax.For the time being we are going to just add fun bits to see it work, as we have some more protocols to write and add.So for now add a message or paste in some ascii art with the help of these links:<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://www.patorjk.com/software/taag/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://www.patorjk.com/software/taag/\" target=\"_self\">ascii text gen</a><br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.ascii-art-generator.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.ascii-art-generator.org/\" target=\"_self\">ascii image gen</a>Remember to paste in with a right click!Now if we return to the file online at:<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://femfester.in-grid.io\" target=\"_self\">https://femfester.in-grid.io</a>we will see our beautiful inputs.prompt\nHow do we negotiate the space of working collectively as one user?\nWhat other considerations need to be voiced?\nWhen we finish up working together there are lots of things we can do to make it easier to return to our work, make it legible to others, as well as caring for the infrastructure we're working in. This could include careful documentation, understanding how to save and record edits, and exiting programs in their nuanced ways.We've finished working together and now we would like to leave our TMUX session. This is a little more complex than it might appear. Leaving a session using an 'exit' command will delete the session for others, and you will lose the record of your edits together. Instead we can either:Close the entire terminal session window, or use Ctrl-b. This will retain the terminal session for you to use again in the future. Let's consider collectively how to ensure we exit safely, using a door rather than an ejector seat. How does this action differ from exiting other softwares and how does this attention affect our relationships.prompt\nHow can we form protocols that enable us to care for who is coming next and which Now we have all the protocols ready lets add them to the HTML file with nano again.Once we have edited the HTML, we can launch our page in a browser! <br>At <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://femfester.in-grid.io/\" target=\"_self\">https://femfester.in-grid.io/</a>Practising infrastructuring collectively can be (intentionally) a slow, careful and unscalable process, so it's important to acknowledge our incremental changes, achievements and presence. <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://wiki4print.servpub.net/index.php?title=Docs:00_Contents#Index_of_Sections\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://wiki4print.servpub.net/index.php?title=Docs:00_Contents#Index_of_Sections\" target=\"_self\">Our (ongoing) documentation</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"(¬_¬)/` Serv(er)ing In-grid","level":1,"id":"(¬_¬)/\\`_Serv(er)ing_In-grid_0"},{"heading":"Workshop Outline","level":1,"id":"Workshop_Outline_0"},{"heading":"Workshop Acknowledgements","level":2,"id":"Workshop_Acknowledgements_0"},{"heading":"Infrastructural Acknowledgements","level":2,"id":"Infrastructural_Acknowledgements_0"},{"heading":"Femfester?","level":2,"id":"Femfester?_0"},{"heading":"Protocols * Manifesto","level":3,"id":"Protocols_\\*_Manifesto_0"},{"heading":"Why thinking through protocols?","level":3,"id":"Why_thinking_through_protocols?_0"},{"heading":"Diagram: of socio-technical relations of Servpub project","level":4,"id":"Diagram_of_socio-technical_relations_of_Servpub_project_0"},{"heading":"Why thinking through Manifesto?","level":4,"id":"Why_thinking_through_Manifesto?_0"},{"heading":"Why Femfester tho?","level":2,"id":"Why_Femfester_tho?_0"},{"heading":"Lets put it to practice","level":1,"id":"Lets_put_it_to_practice_0"},{"heading":"Pre word","level":1,"id":"Pre_word_0"},{"heading":"1.

As we rub up against and dance our way into network practices, a festering acts as a place to form intentions and imagine how we want to collectively meet here. We fester as we care for the holes in our pipelines, tend to the ooze that undulates out and sit with these leaky seamful infrastructures. We don't aim to cure these frictions or plug these holes, but to care for them. We ask how we can enable infrastructuring to fester otherwise from our pulsating practices? A femfestering Server . . . . . - Is a situated technology. The server feels out their context and considers themselves to be part of an ecology of practices. - Is maintained by a community that cares enough for the frictions of accessing and maintaining a server, and where these frictions feel like a generative affair. - Ferments the materiality of software, hardware and the relations of the bodies gathered around them. - Opens themselves to expose the difficult processes, tools, sources, habits and patterns to make accessible these difficulties. - Does not strive for seamlessness, as it creates a bubble. Talk of transparency too often signals that something is being made invisible and inaccessible. - Avoids efficiency, ease-of-use, scalability and immediacy because they can be cages we need to abolish. - Knows that networking is actually an awkward, promiscuous, interdependent and pleasurable practice. - Is autonomous in that they feel out their own dependencies, relations and politics. - Radically questions the conditions for serving and service; practices queering client-server relations where they can. - Approaches network technology and sociotechnical systems as places of social change. - Enables networks and their practices to be improvise-able and read-write accessible. - Does not confuse safety with security. - Takes the risk of exposing their insecurity. - Tries hard not to apologies when they are not available, as they learn to communicate their capacities. In-grid is a trans*feminist collective of artists/musicians/educators/hackers working with*for accessible digital infrastructures. In-grid has been working together since 2019, and is made up of a fluid group of people who bring together exhibitions, infrastructures, parties, workshops and research projects.In the workshop to write the Femfester, In-grid members came together in person and online, ate some nice food and tasty snacks, caught up, but also set up their new server with Servus, and along the way (con)figured out what relations and politics we wanted to bring there and how!These are the prompts we made alongside setting up our VPS server with our members. Each step we reflect, re-imagine, and re(con)figure out what we desire each relation, space and dynamic to be for us together. These were done to enable us to find our collective orientation whilst orienting our infrastructures. These are all notes of much deeper and complex conversations, but try to map and inform where we are at.Here was a pre-figuring out of what we desired our coding relations to be. Doing things in pairs / groups Making sure everyone is on the same page before starting work Documentation *so choices can be rolled back/remade if necessary Be soft with sudo Working slowly, doing things in steps, not rushing through, stopping at a step rather than getting half way through something. double check what you are about to do before doing it, as may be irreversible * Talk Consider institutional implications for managed machines Keep everyone up to date. <br>Here we logged into the server through <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\" target=\"_self\">SSH</a> and questioned the metaphor and figure it brings of a handshake. When creating metaphors mention what is being replaced\nHere we approached the \"sudo\" command (means super user do), which enables admin rights on a system and for you to undertake maintenance. Here we imagined how we desired to configure these processes and rights.When sudo we should take extra care to make sure what we are doing is wanted by all. Work in pairs (if you can)? For any major changes at least... Should we be anonyms sudo? Or su user to trackShould sudo be used alone? Here we set up the users for the server, but also took time to manifest the figures we imagined being on this server. Here questioning the norms of user/server and individualized relations and how we want to enact them together otherwise.Not users but:maintainers?carers?Member?Players?Collaborators and caretakersit is nice to be individuals in a collectivecharactersConversationalistspersonaInfra as another collaborator not users/usingFistulas Here we uploaded SSH keys for those accounts and then closed password access to the server. This in norms makes the server \"sercure\", we took up this to imagine what safety means for us instead of security.Is transparency safety? No single point of failure/hidden information or is it helpful not to be able to delete something.Understanding the risks and making decisions based on understandingNot having knowledge lie with one personEveryone should have ability to access knowledgeDon't make ring-fence around particular rolesHow do we make people feel unafraid of making changesBut at the same time aware of what the \"risks\" areIs it more about learning how to move with caution and careThe idea is not to move fast / gung-ho / \"trigger happy\", but rather checking and double checking before doingHow can we do things like check a process before doing something, I'm thinking of Nginx command to check if the config file is valid before restarting the server... can we try to research that for all software we use? If we end up making our own tools, can we build caution / testing / care into our procedures, so that people feel confident that the changes they are about to make are safe to do? Demystifying what is safe protocols etc. Boundaries are helpful between the server and outside the serverHere we logged into TMUX an SSH multiplexer (basically a way to collaborate on server work). We wanted to imagine what collaborative relations we desired, but got caught up on TMUX technicalities. . . Turns out that typing exit in a string seems to exit it also Nominate who will type, and check in when people are getting tired. Take turns, maybe signal end of a string/phrase? Over, fin, out! fnx your turn bbzHere we turned our attention from (con)figuring out the server to manifesting how we wanted to serve In-grid. Here we started by returning to the original Feminist Server Manifesto, and reading it line by line together, each member taking it in turns, but also doing this no deterministically and one taking after where the other left off. We also chatted about our relations to it and how it had influenced us in our work and lives. Here we then took space to do a sedimented In-grid practice of free writing to enable all members to anonymously (+ without anxiety) and collectively form our own lines for a manifesto.New things: Balance between caution/testing/care and empowerment\nDoes not police language, but reads intentions and actionsForm different relations of access around both technology, critical thought and crip access.Enable us to practice and perform new relations of radical politics that we need now!Is not another cage to hold things in, or protect us from.

Does not police language, but reads intentions and actionsUnderstanding that there is often no one route to the ideals(?) we are trying to embrace but that there are thorny implications and 'seamfull' histories to navigate Transparent about power and how it's being usedNotes: Opens herself to expose processes, tools, sources, habits, patterns (Katie was talking about this as transparency / accessibility) Does not strive for seamlessness. Talk of transparency too often signals that something is being made invisible (what is the relationship between seamlessness and transparency) Seamlessness require a lot of labour and obscure the effort behind the scenes.By making knowledge of a system or the system itself accessible, we don't need to make the system seamless? What is the difference between accessibility and transparency? Accessibility of sudoWe then took the original server manifesto's lines and started to align our own with them, figuring out how we oriented in different ways.A Festering Server is . . . . . a 10 minute manifesto\nIs a situated technology.

In this session questioning how members made sense of and made friction around the social and institutional inflexibilities they came into contact with and were impacted by when organising. This entry reflects on collective action research with In-grid members around how to practice and imagine what technical Docs and network practices have the capacity for when approached through critical access. In these practices questioning how technical configurations and their expertise can make room for being disputed, improvised and manifested from a wide range of backgrounds and approaches.

This entry shares a collective workshop where In-grid members came together to run the Practising Protocols workshop in-ternally. For this iteration we set up our first collective server as well as our first server manifesto called the Femfester. In this workshop making room to find friction within our network infrastructures so to manifest them otherwise. <br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../Practice.md\" href=\"practice.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">&lt;- Back to Practice</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Sub-Inquiries","level":2,"id":"Sub-Inquiries_0"},{"heading":"<a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"In-fra Processing.md\" href=\"In-fra Processing.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">In-fra Processing focus group</a>","level":3,"id":"[In-fra_Processing_focus_group](In-fra%20Processing.md)_0"},{"heading":"<a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"In-Docs.md\" href=\"In-Docs.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">In-Docs</a>","level":3,"id":"[In-Docs](In-Docs.md)_0"},{"heading":"<a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"Collective Infrastructures.md\" href=\"Collective Infrastructures.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Collective Infrastructures Combined Panel</a>","level":3,"id":"[Collective_Infrastructures_Combined_Panel](Collective%20Infrastructures.md)_0"},{"heading":"<a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"Thesis/Repo/Practice/In-Grid/Serving In-grid/Serving In-grid.md\" href=\"Thesis/Repo/Practice/In-Grid/Serving In-grid/Serving In-grid.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Serving In-grid workshop</a>","level":3,"id":"[Serving_In-grid_workshop](Thesis/Repo/Practice/In-Grid/Serving%20In-grid/Serving%20In-grid.md)_0"}],"links":["in-grid/in-fra-processing/in-fra-processing.html","in-grid/in-docs/in-docs.html","thesis/repo/practice/in-grid/collective-infrastructures.html","in-grid/serving-in-grid/serving-in-grid.html","practice.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"thesis/export/web/media/icons/in-configure.svg","fullURL":"in-grid/in-grid's-in-frastructures.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["thesis/export/web/media/icons/in-configure.svg"],"createdTime":1756238143867,"modifiedTime":1761298843221,"sourceSize":3050,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/Practice/In-Grid/In-Grid's In-frastructures.md","exportPath":"in-grid/in-grid's-in-frastructures.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":87,"backlinks":["practice.html"],"type":"markdown"},"research/media/knowledge-base-graph.html":{"title":"Knowledge base graph","icon":"","description":"<img src=\"research/media/knowledge-base-graph.png\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"Thesis/dist/05_research/media/knowledge-base-graph.png","fullURL":"research/media/knowledge-base-graph.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["research/media/knowledge-base-graph.html"],"createdTime":1756238143936,"modifiedTime":1756238143937,"sourceSize":178498,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/Practice/Research/media/Knowledge base graph.png","exportPath":"research/media/knowledge-base-graph.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":90,"backlinks":["research/research-practice.html"],"type":"attachment"},"research/research-practice.html":{"title":"Research Practice","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"A minimal icon illustrates a set of points connected into a network.

To do this here I share the workshop Making Sense with Obsidian that me and Batool Desouky organised for students on the Make Sense program at the Critical Media Lab, FNHW, Basel.

These descriptions aim to accessibly offer up how this research works with crip and queer feminist theory to form critical access informed approaches to community infrastructuring. These terms help to understand how this research makes sense of the many bodies, technologies and relations that it is in touch with. This glossary brings focus to how this research has brought together, moved through and made friction with the unknowable and unpredictable actions of community infrastructuring. Friction is a process of access making. It brings together both the making sense of when access is needed or when friction is felt, with the action of making access through friction, making request and transforming your feelings into change. In crip theory there is also this word play with friction, that even though there can be pain from frictions, there is also a possibility for pleasure and joy, which is often never imagined. Friction in this research is then understood as being a place of joyous, pleasurable and embodied access making in action. Wiggle Room builds from Friction to pose a process of friction making. This process is specifically around the categories and relations that people are prescribed by the norms of systems. With Wiggle Room this process of friction making takes on the approach of feeling out how determined categories and relations misfit the bodies they impact. From this sense making asking how these impacted bodies can Wiggle Room within these determined relations and towards ones that are shaped by and affirm the lives they hold. The Table in this research is a metaphor for the institutional norms that have been gradually sedimented into determined and inflexible relations. Tables in this research are take many forms, from my desk, to excell tables, to kitchen tables, to interview tables, operating tables, and to the grid of cells on a video call. Working with the Table this research asks how these institutes and norms make room for us to be together, and how we can also start to push back and bring these norms in touch with out own tables and relations. The Crip Table builds from the Table to imagine what a Table shaped by crip politics and community would feel like. With this the Crip Table questions how tables can not be held in place, or oriented towards determined bodies and relations, but instead towards promises of life affirmation and justice. The Crip Table making room to imagine how systems, infrastructures and their of inflexible relations can be flexible and shaped by the bodies they impact and are in touch with. The Bodily Horizon in this research makes present and situates how bodies are in relation with things around them. The Bodily Horizon makes room to question what is within reach, what can be changed, and what limits and capacities there are within the actions we take. It both makes sense of the frictions of the present while making room to question what the body wants to be within reach of in the future. With the Bodily Horizon here, it is then a body that is in motion, one that feels and makes change, and one that sits between the present and the future. The Bodymind in crip theory, is the refusal of the split between the mind and body made within western medicine and philosophy. It instead brings together the body and the mind in a way that brings to the foreground the body and it sense making, whilst still caring for the mind. In the breaking down of boundaries between mind and body is also extended in this research to break down the boundaries between bodies and the relations that impact them. In this orientation the Bodymind questions the determined ways bodies, minds and their matters are separated, and makes room to feel how they might come together and transform relations through their entangled sense making.
